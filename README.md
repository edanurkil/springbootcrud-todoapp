# springbootcrud-todoapp
This is a simple Todo application built with Spring Boot, demonstrating basic CRUD operations. Users can add new tasks, mark them as completed with toggle operation, and delete tasks. The application handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks through RESTful methods like GET and POST.

All tasks are stored in a MySQL database, and the frontend is designed with Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.
The database operations are integrated with MySQL Workbench, allowing users to view and manage tasks directly from the Workbench interface.
